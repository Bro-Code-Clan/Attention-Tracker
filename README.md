It is estimated that by 2021, online education market in India is going to be around $ 2BN. 
The main aim of the system is to create a mechanism to monitor and measure the attention span of the learners in the instructor led online sessions.

## Facts about online learning:
Great Learning has academic collaboration with leading Indian and global institutes like Great Lakes institute of management, Purdue University, UT Austin’s McCombs School of Business, Stanford University and so forth to deliver these programs. In flip classroom format, learners are expected to go through video lectures on a weekly basis and then participate in live online instructor led sessions in a micro group containing up to 10 learners. The agenda of instruction led session is to do a quick debrief of video lectures for the week and discuss practical applications of the concepts covered in the video lecture of the week  

Following are a few ideas on the measures that can be used to quantify the level of attention span: 
• out of the designated session-time, what proportion of session was one-way dialogue vs two-way dialogue 
• number of distinct learners who participated in the session 
• presence of background noise, chatters in the session, etc.. Expected Outcomes 
• Real time dashboard that quantifies the participation for each participant 
• Real time triggers in case of sub-optimal participation 
• Suggestions (along with implementation) of other ideas to quantify level / quality of interactions Great Learning will be sharing sample recording of the online mentored sessions
